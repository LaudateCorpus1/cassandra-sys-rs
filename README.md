# cassandra-cpp-sys

This is a maintained Rust project that provides a low-level binding of the 
DataStax cpp driver at https://github.com/datastax/cpp-driver/ .
It is mostly autogenerated.

This project also includes a fairly complete set of examples equivalent to the ones in the C++ repository.

It is quite possible to use this crate directly from your Rust code, but it will mean littering unsafe all over the place.
Instead it is recommended that you use the safe wrapper of this interface: [cassandra-cpp](https://github.com/Metaswitch/cassandra-rs).

For the wrapper to work, you must first have installed the datastax-cpp driver.
Follow the steps in the
[cpp driver docs](https://github.com/datastax/cpp-driver/tree/master/topics#installation)
to do so. Pre-built packages are available for most platforms.

Make sure that the driver (specifically `libcassandra_static.a` and `libcassandra.so`) are in your `/usr/local/lib64/` directory.

You can use this crate from cargo with

```toml
    [dependencies]
    cassandra-cpp-sys = "0.8"
```

## Important note regarding version 0.9.0

This branch is version 0.8.x of cassandra-cpp-sys. Development has begun on version 0.9.x using a newer version of bindgen,
but it is not yet ready for use. See the [version-0.9](https://github.com/Metaswitch/cassandra-sys-rs/tree/version-0.9) branch
to follow its development. In due course this will be merged to master, but for the moment we recommend you use version 0.8.x.
